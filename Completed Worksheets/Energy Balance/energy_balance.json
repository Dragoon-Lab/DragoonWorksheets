The expression \"thermic effect of food\" is used to describe the energy expended by our bodies to consume (bite, chew, and swallow) and process (digest, transport, metabolize, and store) food.</p><p>A factor of 10% is generally used to account for the thermic effect of food. Thus, if you eat 500 calories of food, you will expend 50 calories processing it. However, this is only a rough estimate, because the factor is different for different foods. Processing protein requires the greatest expenditure of energy, with estimates ranging as high as 30%. Dietary fat, on the other hand, is so easily processed and turned into body fat that there is little thermic effect, perhaps only 2% or 3%. The amount of energy required to process carbohydrates falls between that of protein and fat.</p><p>Since we don't know much about Joe's diet, let's just use the default value of 10%. In the table below, which shows the complete model that Joe has developed so far, fill in the blanks to change the node \"digestive activity expenditure\" to be the product of \"energy ingested\" and a parameter \"digestive energy factor\" with the value 0.10."

Parameters are used to represnt constant values.</p><p><i>Example: pi is a <b>parameter</b> because it is always 3.1415.</i></p><p><b>An accumulator</b> represents a quantity that increases or decreases over time based on its previous value and the value of its inputs. These take the form: \"new value = old value + inputs\". It has an initial value that serves as the first \"old value.\"</p><p><i>Example: Population can be an <b>accumulator</b> because its new value is depndent on its old value and its inputs. Current population size = last year's population size + inputs.</i></p><p><b>A function</b> represents a value  that is calculated directly from the values of other quantities, without referencing its previous value. A function differs from an accumulator in that it does not need to know its previous value in order to determine its next value. Thus, a function does not need and does not have a special initial value, whereas an accumulator does.</p><p><i>Example: Suppose you know 20% of the population dies each year, then the number of deaths is a <b>function</b>, namely population * 0.2. Note that the number of deaths each year does not require knowledge of the deaths of the previous year to compute it (if it did, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be an <b>accumulator</b>).</i></p><p><b>Scientific Notation</b> is a great way to rewrite very large and very small numbers. For example, <b>345000</b> can be written in scientific notation to be <b>3.45e+5</b> or <b>3.45 x 10<sup>5</sup></b>.</p><p>To do this, move the decimal place from the end of <b>345000</b> to between the first and second number. So, we move the decimal five places to the left between the <b>3</b> and the <b>4</b>. Then we drop the zeros and write <b>e+5</b>, which is an abbreviation for \"exponenet is +5\" or <b>10<sup5</sup></b>. This indicates how many zeros there are.</p><p>Similarly, </b>0.0000000000000000345</b> can be written as <b>3.45e-17</b> or <b>3.45 x 10<sup>-17</sup></b>."
