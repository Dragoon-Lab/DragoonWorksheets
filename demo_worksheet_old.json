It works by breaking down a system into distinct pieces\u2014called \u201cnodes\u201d in the Dragoon software.  A model is made by defining both nodes and the relationships between them.  In particular, if Node A has an effect on Node B, Node A is considered an \u201cinput\u201d of Node B.  Once all the nodes and inputs are defined, the computer can calculate the change in the system over time and provide you with graphs showing the results.</p><p><b>Parameters, Actuators, Functions</b></p><p>Models in Dragoon are made up of three types of nodes: Paramters, Accumulators, and Functions.<ul><li>Parameters are the simplest type of node. A parameter represents a <b>fixed quantity that never changes</b>. Parameters are used to represent constant values (<i>height of a building</i> being 12 m.</li><li>Accumulators represent <b>a quantity that increases or decreases over time based on its previous value and the value of its inputs</b>. The inputs to an accumulator govern how much it changes over time. At each time step, the inputs are added or subtracted from the value for the accumulator at the current time step to determine its value at the next time step.</li><li>Functions represent a <b>value that is directly related to the values of other quantities, without regard to its own previous value</b>. The inputs to functions determine the value of the function.  A function differs from an accumulator in that it does not need to know its previous value in order to determine its next value.</li></ul>Accumulators and functions seem very similar at first, and it can take some practice to determine if a particular quantity should be represented as one or the other.  To determine if a quantity should be an accumulator, ask the question:  \u201cDoes this quantity add or subtract new values to itself each time step to find its new value?\u201d  If it does, then the quantity is an Accumulator.  If it does not, then the quantity is a Function.  Additionally, Accumulators typically have an initial value associated with them, whereas functions do not.</p><p><b>Example system<b>: Let\u2019s start by modeling a simple system: a population of Dodo birds as they were becoming extinct.  Suppose that there were 1000 Dodo birds in the population initially and that 20% of the Dodo birds died each year.  Thus, the number of deaths in the first year was 1000 * 20% = 200 deaths, leaving 800 Dodos alive at the beginning of the second year.  The number of deaths in the second year was 800 * 20% = 160 deaths, leaving 640 Dodos alive for the start of the third year.   Because the number of Dodo birds and the number of deaths change over the years, this is a dynamic system.",

This is given to us as a constant value of 20% each year, so it is a <b>Parameter</b>.

We are given an initial value for this quantity \u2013 1000 Dodos \u2013 and the number of Dodos alive at the end of each year is dependent on the number alive in the previous year (new population = old population \u2013 deaths).

Wolves preyed on the moose, so their populations were tied together in what is known as a \u201cpredator-prey\u201d relationship\u2014as the number of moose grew, the number of wolves grew in response to having more food available, but then the wolves would eat more moose, causing the moose population to decrease, meaning less food is available for wolves, etc.  This relationship is complicated, so creating a model is necessary for fully understanding the relationship between the two populations.  Let us build up to the final model by making a series of models of simpler systems.  For instance, the first few systems pretend that Isle Royale has only moose on it and no wolves on it.",

We are given an initial value for this quantity \u2013 1000 Dodos \u2013 and the number of Dodos alive at the end of each year is dependent on the number alive in the previous year (new population = old population \u2013 deaths).  Thus we know the <i>population</i> node is an <b>Accumulator</b>. </li><li><i>Deaths</i> represents the number of Dodos that die in a given year.  This is a quantity that is completely determined by the value of two other inputs (<i>population</i> * <i>death rate</i>).  Note that the number of deaths each year does not require knowledge of the deaths of the previous year to compute; this means the <i>deaths</i> node is a <b>Function</b>.</li></ul>Please open the \u201cDodo extinction\u201d model in the \u201cIntroductory\u201d category of the Dragoon software.
