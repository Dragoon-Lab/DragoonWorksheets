<h1>Workbook 2</h1>
<h1>Working With Dragoon</h1>
<h4>Key Terms & Concepts</h4>
<p><b>A Parameter</b> represents a fixed quantity that never changes. Parameters are used to represent constant values.</p>
<p><i>Example: pi is a <b>parameter</b> because it is always 3.1415.</i></p>
<p><b>An accumulator</b> represents a quantity that increases of decreases over time based on its previous value and the value of its inputs. These take the form: "new value = old value + inputs". It has an initial value that serves as the first "old value".</p>
<p><i>Example: Population can be an <b>accumulator</b> because its new value is dependent on its old value and its inputs. Current population size = last year's population size + inputs.</i></p>
<p><b>A function</b> represents a value that is calculated directly from the values of other quantities, without referencing its previous value. A function differs from an accumulator in that it does not need to know its previous value in order to determine its next value. Thus, a function does not need and does not have a special initial value, whereas an accumulator does.</p>
<p><i>Example: Suppose you know 20% of the population dies each year, then the number of deaths is a <b>function</b>, namely population * 0.2. Note that the number of the deaths does not require knowledge of the deaths of the previous year to comupte it (if it did, it'd be an <b>accumulator</b>).</i></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>Scientific Notation</b> is a great way to rewrite very large and very small numbers. For example, <b>345000</b> can be rewritten in scientific notation to be <b>3.45e+5</b> or <b>3.45x10<sup>5</sup></b>.</p>
<p>To do this, move the decimal place from the end of <b>345000</b> in between the first and second number. So, we move the decimal five places to the left between the <b>3</b> and the <b>4</b>. Then we drop the zeros and write <b>e+5</b>, which is an abbreviation for "exponent is +5" or <b>10<sup>5</sup></b>. This indicates how many zeroes there are.</p>
<p>Similarly, <b>0.0000000000000000345</b> can be rewritten as <b>3.45e-17</b> or <b>3.45x10<sup>-17</sup></b>.</p>

<p>On your computer, complete the following steps to create a Dragoon model for Energy Balance.</p>
<ol>
<li>To start defining a node, click on the <b>Create Node</b> button in the top left corner. The following window should pop up:</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon9.JPG"/>
<li>The blank dropdown menu labeled <b>Description</b> is for the name and description for the node. Select <b>energy stored in Joe's body each day</b>.</li>
<li>A message should pop up saying <!--highlight-->"[insert correct message here]". This message is from the tutoring system. It knows what the correct model is and will help you create it. when your blank turns green, it means that you have done this correctly. Click on <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Next, select the node <b>Type</b>. Try choosing <b>Parameter</b>.</li>
<li>Oops-- be careful! If you choose the wrong type, the box will turn red.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon10.JPG"/>
<li>The correct answer in this case is <b>Accumulator</b>. The problem gives this to you, but often, you will have to read through the prompt and figure it out on your own. See the Key Terms & Concepts at the beginning of this workbook to review node types.</li>
<li>Input the correct <b>initial value</b>. (If you input the incorrect value more than two times, the box will turn yellow with the correct choice.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon11.JPG"/>
<li>Enter <b>345000</b> for the <b>Initial Value</b> and select <b>calories</b> for <b>units</b></li>
<li>The next option you should see is <b>Inputs</b> followed by mathematical operations (+,-,*,/). Skip these for now and focus on the <b>Expression</b> box.</li>
<li>The <b>Expression</b> box is where you define the calculation for your node. To do this, you can add <b>Inputs</b>, which are the other nodes in your problem, as well as click on mathematical operations to put them in your calculation. At any point in your node creation, when you think you are done with your expression, press <b>Check Expression</b> to receive feedback on your answer. Above the <b>Expression</b> box, you will see the beginning part of the calculation. In this case, you should see <b>new energy stored = old energy stored +</b>. Finish this calculation with the inputs in the box. In this case, add the input <b>energy balance</b> by clicking on the dropdown option for <b>Inputs</b> and select the correct response. Click <b>Check Expression</b>. The expression box should turn green if you put in the correct calculation.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon12.JPG"/>
<li>When you have finished and all the boxes are completed (<b>Inputs</b> will never be completed because it just contains options for the expresion), click <b>Done</b> in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Congratulations! You have created your first node. You should immediately notice two things. First, another node has been created in addition to the <b>energy stored</b> one you made. This is because you used it in your calculation in the <b>Description</b>. anything that hasn't been created yet but you use in your calculation should automatically appear when you are done defining your node. Second, you may notice that the node you created, <b>energy stored</b>, has a solid, yellow border around it. The border will change depending on how well you did in creating your node. The border may be solid (signifying the node has been defined completely) or dotted (signifying the node isn't completely defined and you won't be able to graph your model). In addition, the border may be red (you didn't correctly define the node on your own), green (you corretly defined the node on your own, or yellow (the answer was given for you on some nodes). Shoot for making your nodes all green!</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon13.JPG"/>
<li>Go ahead and double-click the blue <b>energy balance</b> triangle and try to define the node on your own! <i>Hint, the answer is in the prompt.</i></li>
<li>When you are finished, you should see this message. It's time to graph your model!</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon14.JPG"/>
<li>Click on the <b>Graph</b> button on the top menu bar. You should see this:</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon15.JPG"/>
<li>If you haven't finished completing your mdoel, you cannot graph it and the following message will pop up. When this happens, look for nodes that have dotted lines around them. This means they are not completely defined and need to be finished.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon16.JPG"/>

<h3><b>Question 5:</b></h3>
<p>5a. If Joe continues his ingesting/expending patterns, in about how many days will Joe weigh about 130 lbs?</p>
<input type="text" id="questsect32">
<p>5b. What happens to the graph if Joe changes his energy ingested from 1989 calories to 2.11e+3 calories? What does that mean?</p>
<input type="text" id="questsect33">
<p>5c. Uncheck "<b>Show weight</b>" and check either "<b>Show energy balance</b>" or "<b>Show weight change</b>" Why don't either of these graphs have a slope?</p>
<input type="text" id="questsect33">
<p>5d. "<b>Show energy balance</b>" or "<b>Show weight change</b>" are:</p>
<input type="radio" name="radio" id="questsect34" value="constant">Constant<br>
<input type="radio" name="radio" id="questsect34" value="dynamic">Dynamic
<p>5e. Vary the energy ingested values. Hoe many calories can Joe ingest and keep his weight constant?</p>
<input type="text" id="questsect35">
<p>5f. Think about the expression for energy balance. Why does your answer in 5 make sense?</p>
<input type="text" id="questsect36">
<ol>
<li>Under "<b>Additional Dragoon Problem</b>" in the main window, make sure that the <b>Problem Category</b> option reads "<b>Energy Balance</b>" and the <b>Problem</b> option reads "<b>Energy Balance 3</b>".</li>
<li>Read the text adnd modify the model.</li>
<li>When you have completed the model, click on the "<b>Graph</b>" button on the top menu bar. Keep in mind that you cannot graph you rmodel if your nodes aren't completely defined. Look for nodes that have dotted lines around them.</li>
<li>In the graph window, make sure only "<b>Show weight</b>" is checked. Vary the sliders of every parameter while checking that the way the graph changes makes sense given how you changed the parameter's value.</li>
<li>When you're done playing with the values, close the Graph window and reopen it with the Graph button. This resets the sliders to their original positions.</li>

<h3><b>Question 6:</b></h3>
<p>6a. If Joe then becomes less active (change physical activity expenditure to 300), then what happens to the graph and what does this mean about his weight?</p>
<input type="text" id="questsect37">
<p>6b. Increase Joe's physical activity expenditure to 70 calories. About how much energy can he ingest before he gains weight now?</p>
<ol>
<li>Under "<b>Additional Dragoon Problem</b>" in the main window, make sure that the <b>Problem Category</b> option reads "<b>Energy Balance</b>" and the <b>Problem</b> option reads "<b>Energy Balance 4</b>".</li>
<li>Read the text and modify the model. View the Graph, and manipulate the values of the parameters to make sure the graphs change in sensible ways.</li>
</ol>
