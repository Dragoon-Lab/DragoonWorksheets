Parameters are used to represent constant values.</p><p><i>Example: pi is a <b>parameter</b> because it is always 3.1415.</i></p><p><b>An accumulator</b> represents a quantity that increases or decreases over time based on its previous value and the value of its inputs. These take the form: \"new value = old value + inputs\". It has an initail value that serves the first \"old value.\"</p><p><i>Example: population can be an <b>accumulator</b> because its new value is dependent on its old value and its inputs. Current population size = last year's population size + inputs.</i></p><p>A <b>function</b> represents a value that is calculated directly from the values of other quantities, <i>without</i> referencing its previous value. A function differs from an accumulator in that it does not need to know its previous value to determine its next value. Thus, a function does not need to have a special initial value, whereas an accumulator does.</p><p><i>Example: Suppose you know 20% of the population dies each year, then the number of deaths is a <b>function</b>, namely population * 0.2. Note that the number of deaths each year does not require knowledge of the deaths of the previous year to compute it (if it did, it'd be an <b>accumulator</b>).</i></p><p><b>Scientific Notation</b> is a great way to rewrite very large and very small numbers. For example, <b>345000</b> can be written in scientific notation to be <b>3.45e+5</b> or <b>3.45 x 10<sup>5</sup></b>.</p><p>To do this, move the decimal place from the end of <b>345000</b> to between the first and second number. So, we move the decimal five places to the left between the <b>3</b> and the <b>4</b>. Then we drop the zeros and write <b>e+5</b>, which is an abbreviation for \"exponent is +5\" or <b>10<sup5</sup></b>. This indicates how many zeros there are.</p><p>Similarly, <b>0.0000000000000000345</b> can be written as <b>3.45e-17</b> or <b>3.45 x 10<sup>-17</sup></b>."

Thus, humans developed the ability to store energy from food. When there is too little energy from ingestion, then the body converts fat and other tissues back into energy.</p><p>Let's suppose Joe wants us to build an accurate model of his weight changes, so he starts with a very simple model, which is that the energy stored (as fat, etc.) changes daily depending on the energy balance. The energy balance is the difference between the energy ingested and the energy burned by the body on that day. When the energy balance is positive on a particular day (a good hunt!), then energy storage increases by the surplus. When energy balance is negative (a poor hunt), then stored energy decreases.</p><p>Joe looks up his current weight in a physiology reference and finds that he has about 345,000 calories stored. To keep things simple while getting started on his modeling project, Joe assumes his energy balance is 100 calories every day. He wants to model how his stored energy increases daily. Please answer questions below about the model Joe must build."
