<li>Under <b>Additional Dragoon Problems</b> in the main window, make sure that the <b>Problem Category</b> option reads <b>Energy Balance</b> and the <b>Problem</b> option reads <b>Energy Balance 0</b>. click on the <b>Open problem</b> button, boxed in the screenshot below.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon7.JPG"/>
<li>The following window should appear. This is your workspace for the <b>Energy Balance - Level 0</b> problem. Here, you will model different systems and graph them!</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon8.JPG"/>
<p>It doesn't look like much, but that is because you still need to create your nodes.</p>
</ol>
<p>Before doing anything on the computer, read the text "Your body burns energy..." on the screen and then fill in these blanks on this table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<td>Node Name</td>
<td>Node Type (parameter, accumulator, or function)</td>
<td>Description<td/>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>energy balance</td>
<td><form><input type="text" name="burn1"></form></td>
<td>Small surplus per day, value = 100 calories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>energy stored</td>
<td><form><input type="text" name="burn2"></form></td>
<td>Is equal to its value today plus energy balance for today, initial value = 345000 calories</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On your computer, complete the following steps to create a Dragoon model for Energy Balance.</p>
<ol>
<li>To start defining a node, click on the <b>Create Node</b> button in the top left corner. The following window should pop up:</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon9.JPG"/>
<li>The blank dropdown menu labeled <b>Description</b> is for the name and description for the node. Select <b>energy stored in Joe's body each day</b>.</li>
<li>A message should pop up saying <!--highlight-->"[insert correct message here]". This message is from the tutoring system. It knows what the correct model is and will help you create it. when your blank turns green, it means that you have done this correctly. Click on <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Next, select the node <b>Type</b>. Try choosing <b>Parameter</b>.</li>
<li>Oops-- be careful! If you choose the wrong type, the box will turn red.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon10.JPG"/>
<li>The correct answer in this case is <b>Accumulator</b>. The problem gives this to you, but often, you will have to read through the prompt and figure it out on your own. See the Key Terms & Concepts at the beginning of this workbook to review node types.</li>
<li>Input the correct <b>initial value</b>. (If you input the incorrect value more than two times, the box will turn yellow with the correct choice.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon11.JPG"/>
<li>Enter <b>345000</b> for the <b>Initial Value</b> and select <b>calories</b> for <b>units</b></li>
<li>The next option you should see is <b>Inputs</b> followed by mathematical operations (+,-,*,/). Skip these for now and focus on the <b>Expression</b> box.</li>
<li>The <b>Expression</b> box is where you define the calculation for your node. To do this, you can add <b>Inputs</b>, which are the other nodes in your problem, as well as click on mathematical operations to put them in your calculation. At any point in your node creation, when you think you are done with your expression, press <b>Check Expression</b> to receive feedback on your answer. Above the <b>Expression</b> box, you will see the beginning part of the calculation. In this case, you should see <b>new energy stored = old energy stored +</b>. Finish this calculation with the inputs in the box. In this case, add the input <b>energy balance</b> by clicking on the dropdown option for <b>Inputs</b> and select the correct response. Click <b>Check Expression</b>. The expression box should turn green if you put in the correct calculation.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon12.JPG"/>
<li>When you have finished and all the boxes are completed (<b>Inputs</b> will never be completed because it just contains options for the expresion), click <b>Done</b> in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Congratulations! You have created your first node. You should immediately notice two things. First, another node has been created in addition to the <b>energy stored</b> one you made. This is because you used it in your calculation in the <b>Description</b>. anything that hasn't been created yet but you use in your calculation should automatically appear when you are done defining your node. Second, you may notice that the node you created, <b>energy stored</b>, has a solid, yellow border around it. The border will change depending on how well you did in creating your node. The border may be solid (signifying the node has been defined completely) or dotted (signifying the node isn't completely defined and you won't be able to graph your model). In addition, the border may be red (you didn't correctly define the node on your own), green (you corretly defined the node on your own, or yellow (the answer was given for you on some nodes). Shoot for making your nodes all green!</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon13.JPG"/>
<li>Go ahead and double-click the blue <b>energy balance</b> triangle and try to define the node on your own! <i>Hint, the answer is in the prompt.</i></li>
<li>When you are finished, you should see this message. It's time to graph your model!</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon14.JPG"/>
<li>Click on the <b>Graph</b> button on the top menu bar. You should see this:</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon15.JPG"/>
<li>If you haven't finished completing your mdoel, you cannot graph it and the following message will pop up. When this happens, look for nodes that have dotted lines around them. This means they are not completely defined and need to be finished.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon16.JPG"/>
</ol>
<p><b>When you have successfully finished creating your model, the graph window should pop up when you click on the button. Now you can answer the following questions.</b></p>
<h3><b>Question 1</b></h3>
<p>In the graph window, vary the values of energy balance and initial energy stored by draggong the sliders back and forth along the lines (boxed below) or by typing in different values in the boxes (boxed below).</p>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon17.JPG"/>
<p>1a. What is the vertical axis on this graph?</p>
<form><input type="text" name="questsect1"></form>
<p>1b. What happens to the graph if you change the energy balance from 100 calories to 300 calories?</p>
<form><input type="text" name="questsect2"></form>
<p>1c. What happens to the graph if you change the initial energy stored? Change the value from 345000 calories to 3000 calories. Don't forget to reset energy balance to 100 calories.</p>
<form><input type="text" name="questsect3"></form>
<p>When you are finished with these problems, close the graphing window and open the table by clicking on the <b>Table</b> button on the top menu bar.</p>
<h3><b>Question 2</b></h3>
<p>In the table window, scroll to the very bottom and vary the values of energy balance and initial energy stored, just as you did before with the graph (by dragging the sliders back and forth along the lines or by typing in different values in the boxes).</p>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon18.JPG/>
<p>Notice how the table may change. When you're done playing with the values, answer the following questions.</p>
<form>
<p>2a. On what day does energy stored hit 3.46e+5 calories?</p>
<p>Day <input type="number" name="questsect4"></p>
<p>2b. On what day does energy stored hit 3.47e+5 calories?</p>
<p>Day <input type="number" name="questsect5"></p>
<p>2c. What is the energy stored on Day 9?</p>
<p><input type="number" name="questsect6"> calories</p>
<p>2d. What is the energy stored value on Day 0 and on day 29.5 (the first and last value)?</p>
<p>Day 0: <input type="number" name="questsect7"></p>
<p>Day 29.5: <input type="number" name="questsect8"></p>
<p>2e. If energy balance changed from 100 calories to 300 calories, on what day does the energy stored hit 3.46e+5 calories?</p>
<p>Day <input type="number" name="questsect9"></p>
<p>2f. If the initial energy charged from 345000 calories to 3000 calories, what is the value on Day 0 and on Day 29.5 (the first and last values>? <i>Don't forget to reset energy back to 100 calories.</i></p>
<p>Day 0: <input type="number" name="questsect10"></p>
<p>Day 29.5: <input type="number" name="questsect11"</p>
<p>2g. Why are your answers so different for questions 2d and 2f? What does this mean?</p>
<input type="number" name="questsect12">

<li>When you are done filling in this table, start defining/refining your nodes. Click on the <b>Create Node</b> button in the top left corner as you did before, or you can double-click on an already created node in the window. If you have described your nodes properly in the table above, creating nodes should be simple-- you have all the information you need right here!</li>
<li>Create these four nodes in Dragoon. When you have completed them, click on the <b>Graph</b> button on the top menu bar. Keep in mind that you cannot graph your model if your nodes aren't completely defined. Look for nodes that have dotted lines around them.</li>
