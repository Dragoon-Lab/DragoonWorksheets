<p>It doesn't look like much, but that is because you still need to create your nodes.</p>
</ol>
<p>Before doing anything on the computer, read the text "Your body burns energy..." on the screen and then fill in these blanks on this table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<td>Node Name</td>
<td>Node Type (parameter, accumulator, or function)</td>
<td>Description<td/>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>energy balance</td>
<td><form><input type="text" name="burn1"></form></td>
<td>Small surplus per day, value = 100 calories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>energy stored</td>
<td><form><input type="text" name="burn2"></form></td>
<td>Is equal to its value today plus energy balance for today, initial value = 345000 calories</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On your computer, complete the following steps to create a Dragoon model for Energy Balance.</p>
<ol>
<li>To start defining a node, click on the <b>Create Node</b> button in the top left corner. The following window should pop up:</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon9.JPG"/>
<li>The blank dropdown menu labeled <b>Description</b> is for the name and description for the node. Select <b>energy stored in Joe's body each day</b>.</li>
<li>A message should pop up saying <!--highlight-->"[insert correct message here]". This message is from the tutoring system. It knows what the correct model is and will help you create it. when your blank turns green, it means that you have done this correctly. Click on <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Next, select the node <b>Type</b>. Try choosing <b>Parameter</b>.</li>
<li>Oops-- be careful! If you choose the wrong type, the box will turn red.</li>
