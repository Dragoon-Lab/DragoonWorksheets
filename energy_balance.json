                    "gen": "The energy balance of your body is the difference between the energy you add to your body by ingesting food and the energy you subtract from your body by physical exercise and other activities. When the energy you ingest exactly equals the energy you expend, the energy balance is zero. When the energy you ingest is greater than the energy you expend, the energy balance is positive and the excess energy is added to the body's energy stores. When you consume less energy than you expend, the energy balance is negative and your body makes up the deficit by withdrawing energy from storage. The energy balance can change each day. Thus, if the energy balance is positive on a particular day, then the energy stored goes up by that amount during the day. If the energy balance is negative, then the energy stored goes down.</p><p>Joe's next model of his energy balance is more complex. It makes energy balance a function of energy ingested and energy expended. Eventually, this will allow him to vary them separately. For instance, he can see what happens if he keeps his diet the same (and hence energy ingested is the same as it is now) but he does more exercise (so his energy expended is higher than it is now). However, for now he assumes that his daily expenditure is 2100 calories and his daily ingestion nets him 1989 calories.",
