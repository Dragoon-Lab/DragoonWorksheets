<li>Log into the computer like you usually do and open a web browser by clicking on its icon.</li>
<li>In the address bar, type in: dragoon.asu.edu/forum_test</li>
<li>The following screen should come up. (If it doesn't, double-check that the address is correct before asking your teacher for help.) Click on the <b>Register</b> button. This is boxed below.</li>\

<li>The following screen should come up. Click on the <b>I agree to these terms</b> button. This is boxed below.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon2.JPG"/>
<li>The following screen should come up. Create a username that is your first name. (However, if there is another student in your class with the same first name as you, then append the first letter of your last name. For instance, if you are John Smith and there is another student named John, then you should use JohnS as your username.) Type your email address and create a secure password on this page. (If you don't have an email address, then ask the teacher for an email address to use; if you forget your password, it can be sent to that email address.) Also type in the confirmation code that you see at the bottom of the page. This will be differant than the code in the images shown here. If you cannot read your conformation code, click the <b>Refresh confirmation code</b> button. When you are finished, click the <b>Submit</b> button, boxed below</li>

<li>The following screen should come up. This means that you have successfully created a forum account. You will receive an email confirming your account creation. Re-type dragoon.asu.edu/forum_test in the search bar, or click on the <b>Return to the index page</b> link. This is boxed below.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon4.JPG"/>
<li>You should be back to the first page you visited. Type in the username and password you just created and click on the <b>Login</b> button. This is boxed below.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon5.JPG"/>
<li>The following screen should come up. This is the main forum window that you will be working with, except that it will have your class's name instead of "Steve Eno's class."</li>

<p><b>When you see this, you have successfully logged onto the forum. Congratulations!</b></p>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Under <b>Additional Dragoon Problems</b> in the main window, make sure that the <b>Problem Category</b> option reads <b>Energy Balance</b> and the <b>Problem</b> option reads <b>Energy Balance 0</b>. click on the <b>Open problem</b> button, boxed in the screenshot below.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon7.JPG"/>
<li>The following window should appear. This is your workspace for the <b>Energy Balance - Level 0</b> problem. Here, you will model different systems and graph them!</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon8.JPG"/>
<p>It doesn't look like much, but that is because you still need to create your nodes.</p>
</ol>
<p>Before doing anything on the computer, read the text "Your body burns energy..." on the screen and then fill in these blanks on this table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<td>Node Name</td>
<td>Node Type (parameter, accumulator, or function)</td>
<td>Description<td/>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>energy balance</td>
<td><form><input type="text" name="burn1"></form></td>
<td>Small surplus per day, value = 100 calories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>energy stored</td>
<td><form><input type="text" name="burn2"></form></td>
<td>Is equal to its value today plus energy balance for today, initial value = 345000 calories</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On your computer, complete the following steps to create a Dragoon model for Energy Balance.</p>
<ol>
<li>To start defining a node, click on the <b>Create Node</b> button in the top left corner. The following window should pop up:</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon9.JPG"/>
<li>The blank dropdown menu labeled <b>Description</b> is for the name and description for the node. Select <b>energy stored in Joe's body each day</b>.</li>
<li>A message should pop up saying <!--highlight-->"[insert correct message here]". This message is from the tutoring system. It knows what the correct model is and will help you create it. when your blank turns green, it means that you have done this correctly. Click on <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Next, select the node <b>Type</b>. Try choosing <b>Parameter</b>.</li>
<li>Oops-- be careful! If you choose the wrong type, the box will turn red.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon10.JPG"/>
<li>The correct answer in this case is <b>Accumulator</b>. The problem gives this to you, but often, you will have to read through the prompt and figure it out on your own. See the Key Terms & Concepts at the beginning of this workbook to review node types.</li>
<li>Input the correct <b>initial value</b>. (If you input the incorrect value more than two times, the box will turn yellow with the correct choice.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon11.JPG"/>
<li>Enter <b>345000</b> for the <b>Initial Value</b> and select <b>calories</b> for <b>units</b></li>
<li>The next option you should see is <b>Inputs</b> followed by mathematical operations (+,-,*,/). Skip these for now and focus on the <b>Expression</b> box.</li>
<li>The <b>Expression</b> box is where you define the calculation for your node. To do this, you can add <b>Inputs</b>, which are the other nodes in your problem, as well as click on mathematical operations to put them in your calculation. At any point in your node creation, when you think you are done with your expression, press <b>Check Expression</b> to receive feedback on your answer. Above the <b>Expression</b> box, you will see the beginning part of the calculation. In this case, you should see <b>new energy stored = old energy stored +</b>. Finish this calculation with the inputs in the box. In this case, add the input <b>energy balance</b> by clicking on the dropdown option for <b>Inputs</b> and select the correct response. Click <b>Check Expression</b>. The expression box should turn green if you put in the correct calculation.</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon12.JPG"/>
<li>When you have finished and all the boxes are completed (<b>Inputs</b> will never be completed because it just contains options for the expresion), click <b>Done</b> in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Congratulations! You have created your first node. You should immediately notice two things. First, another node has been created in addition to the <b>energy stored</b> one you made. This is because you used it in your calculation in the <b>Description</b>. anything that hasn't been created yet but you use in your calculation should automatically appear when you are done defining your node. Second, you may notice that the node you created, <b>energy stored</b>, has a solid, yellow border around it. The border will change depending on how well you did in creating your node. The border may be solid (signifying the node has been defined completely) or dotted (signifying the node isn't completely defined and you won't be able to graph your model). In addition, the border may be red (you didn't correctly define the node on your own), green (you corretly defined the node on your own, or yellow (the answer was given for you on some nodes). Shoot for making your nodes all green!</li>

<li>Go ahead and double-click the blue <b>energy balance</b> triangle and try to define the node on your own! <i>Hint, the answer is in the prompt.</i></li>
<li>When you are finished, you should see this message. It's time to graph your model!</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon14.JPG"/>
<li>Click on the <b>Graph</b> button on the top menu bar. You should see this:</li>
<img src="dragoonintropictures/dragoon15.JPG"/>
<li>If you haven't finished completing your mdoel, you cannot graph it and the following message will pop up. When this happens, look for nodes that have dotted lines around them. This means they are not completely defined and need to be finished.</li>

</ol>
<p><b>When you have successfully finished creating your model, the graph window should pop up when you click on the button. Now you can answer the following questions.</b></p>
