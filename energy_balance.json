Parameters are used to represnt constant values.</p><p><i>Example: pi is a <b>parameter</i> because it is always 3.1415.</i></p><p><b>An accumulator</b> represents a quantity that increases or decreases over time based on its previous value and the value of its inputs. These take the form: \"new value = old value + inputs\". It has an initial value that serves as the first \"old value.\"</p><p><i>Example: Population can be an <b>accumulator</b> because its new value is depndent on its old value and its inputs. Current population size = last year's population size + inputs.</i></p><p><b>A function</b> represents a value  that is calculated directly from the values of other quantities, without referencing its previous value. A function differs from an accumulator in that it does not need to know its previous value in order to determine its next value. Thus, a function does not need and does not have a special initial value, whereas an accumulator does.</p><p><i>Example: Suppose you know 20% of the population dies each year, then the number of deaths is a <b>function</b>, namely population * 0.2. Note that the number of deaths each year does not require knowledge of the deaths of the previous year to compute it (if it did, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be an <b>accumulator</b>).</i></p><p><b>Scientific Notation</b> is a great way to rewrite very large and very small numbers. For example, <b>345000</b> can be written in scientific notation to be <b>3.45e+5</b> or <b>3.45 x 10<sup>5</sup></b>.</p><p>To do this, move the decimal place from the end of <b>345000</b> to between the first and second number. So, we move the decimal five places to the left between the <b>3</b> and the <b>4</b>. Then we drop the zeros and write <b>e+5</b>, which is an abbreviation for \"exponenet is +5\" or <b>10<sup5</sup></b>. This indicates how many zeros there are.</p><p>Similarly, </b>0.0000000000000000345</b> can be written as <b>3.45e-17</b> or <b>3.45 x 10<sup>-17</sup></b>.",
