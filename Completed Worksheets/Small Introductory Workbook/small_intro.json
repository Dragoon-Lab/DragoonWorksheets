It works by viewing the system as interacting quantities&mdash;called &quot;nodes&quot; in the Dragoon software.  A model is made by defining both nodes and the mathematical relationships between them.  In particular, if Node A has an effect on Node B, Node A is considered an &quot;input&quot; of Node B.  Once all the nodes and inputs are defined, the computer can calculate the change in the system over time and graph the results.</p><p><b>Parameters, Accumulators, and Functions</b></p><p>Models in Dragoon are made up of three types of nodes:  Parameters, Accumulators, and Functions.<ul><li>Parameters are the simplest type of node.  A parameter represents a <b>fixed quantity that never changes</b>.  Parameters are used to represent constant values (height of building being 12 m).</li><li>An accumulator represents a <b>quantity that accumulates the values of its inputs over time</b>.  As each input arrives, it changes the value of the accumulator, so inputs represent changes to the accumulator&#39;s value.  At each time step, the inputs are added or subtracted from the current value of the accumulator&mdash;that determines its value at the next time step.</li><li>Functions represent <b>a value that is directly related to the values of its inputs, without regard to its own previous value</b>.  The inputs to functions determine the value of the function.  A function differs from an accumulator in that it does not need to know its previous value in order to determine its next value.</li></ul>Accumulators and functions seem very similar at first, and it can take some practice to determine if a particular quantity should be represented as one or the other.  To determine if a quantity should be an accumulator, ask the question:  &quot;Does this quantity add or subtract new values to itself each time step to find its new value?&quot; If it does, then the quantity is an Accumulator.  If it does not, then the quantity is a Function.  Additionally, Accumulators typically have an initial value associated with them, whereas Functions do not.</p><h3>Example system:</h3><p> Let&#39;s start by modeling a simple system: a population of dodo birds as they were becoming extinct.  Suppose that there were 1000 dodo birds (pronounced &quot;doh doh&quot;) in the population initially and that 20% of the dodo birds died each year.  Thus, the number of deaths in the first year was 1000 * 20% = 200 deaths, leaving 800 dodos alive at the beginning of the second year.  The number of deaths in the second year was 800 * 20% = 160 deaths, leaving 640 dodos alive for the start of the third year. Because the number of dodo birds and the number of deaths change over the years, this is a dynamic system.",

So let us build a model to represent this dynamic system of a shrinking dodo population.

This is given to us as a constant value of 20% each year, so it is a <b>Parameter</b>.  Because Dragoon doesn&#39;t understand percentages, the value of <i>death rate</i> is 0.2.</li><li><i>Population</i> represents the number of dodos still alive.  We are given an initial value for this quantity, 1000 dodos, and the number of dodos alive at the end of each year is dependent on the number alive in the previous year (new population = old population &#45; deaths).  Thus we know the <i>population</i> node is an <b>Accumulator</b>.</li><li><i>Deaths</i> represents the number of dodos that die in a given year.  This is a quantity that is completely determined by the value of two other inputs (population * death rate).  Note that the number of deaths each year does not require knowledge of the deaths of the previous year to compute; this means the <i>deaths</i> node is a <b>Function</b>.</li></ul>A Dragoon model for this system would look like this:"
